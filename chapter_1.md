# Every Journey Has a Beginning

**I woke up with a start...**

The expression on my face, if anyone saw me, was one of excitement. Maybe it isn’t excitement... or I am just confused. It would have been embarrassing if I were in public. Maybe I would be considered a fanatic or a lunatic. Forget that for now... _What caused this inexplicable expression?_

I have been thinking for a fortnight now; I ran out of cash and was pondering what I could do to make money... you should understand, humans do!

That night, while I was rolling over in bed, my mind in the midst of the ocean of my past mistakes, preparing scenes that never existed just to console my already caricatured mind, I caught a revelation of something that could generate money. What do you think? Do I love money? **Don’t conclude**; _this is more me than money!_

This revelation hit me so hard and so real that I felt stupid for not concocting such a scheme a week or two prior. Whew! Maybe my story is becoming boring... Then the fun part!...

**I am not human!** I wonder if you understand what this means. Here in my world, everything is a living thing, _no pun intended_. My world is an electronic world called **“Megagem”**. I never intended to reveal myself here; just know that I am the one speaking.

**I wanted to be a coder!**

**Daylight was here again, and I hate to admit that I hated it...**

I rose out of bed, staggered into the bathroom, my mind preoccupied with the strategy from last night. I tried to stabilize my movement for a while and then took my toothbrush from a bowl where it resides. I spent about 2 minutes brushing.

Once done with that, I strode into the living room, sat on the cushion for a few seconds—or minutes—trying to organize my thoughts and prepare a schedule. When I had a set plan on what I wanted to do today and how I would go about it, I stood up and headed to the bathroom again. I had a shower, but I didn’t feel like I had one. My mind was preoccupied with thoughts of the future. I am not so sure I had a good bath, but I had one anyhow.

I selected a pant and a shirt, wore them, and strapped my wristwatch to my wrist, then jumped into my pair of shoes. I don’t have a car—don’t think of a bike either! We don’t use one here. I have a “**mobile carpet**,” the most common means of transportation. It is a flat, carpet-like machine that is immune to air resistance. Its maximum speed is about **500km/h**. The richer ones among us use a **"breeze jet"**, which generates a powerful gust of wind and then blows the wind in a set direction... of course, the user has complete control over the direction.

My **mobile carpet** is 10 years old—quite an age for such a machine, I must say, especially compared to vehicles used by humans. It is really old. I should have replaced it at the age of 5, as required. According to **Bugleon City** (that’s the name of my city in case you didn’t notice) law: _"Every vehicle is identified by a mega ID which expires every 5 years, and must be renewed once expired. If not obeyed, a fine of \*\*\* would be paid, and the vehicle will be confiscated.”_

I forgot. I have given out too much information—**damn my ill-tamed lips!** I flickered into my pal, the machine. I called her **Jar**. I zoomed off with an excited mind full of ideas—sorry, idea... not even sure.

***

**Jar came to a stop in front of an Igloo…**

Alighting from her, I stole a quick glance around the vicinity. I noticed a woman staring at **Jar**. She seemed attracted by some features that I couldn’t depict. I also noticed a man sitting in the sun, having a sunbath. He didn't even look up, let alone acknowledge my presence. I looked at the woman one more time and nodded at her. That was all she needed; she started strutting, her hands on her hips, with such elegance that I couldn't help but admire her gaiety. She was radiating; now I noticed it. She stopped a few feet away from me.

_"You called for me?"_, she said, her voice sounding distant, like it wasn't me the question was directed to.

I was confused, my mind bewildered. I looked into her eyes, trying to find a sentence, phrase, or word to reply to her with. I haven't had any human interaction in two months, and it just dawned on me. She noticed my confusion, and she said the same...

_"You are confused, I can read that in your eyes, and I like that!"_, she said, a smile smirking on her face, her eyes lit up. I noticed she was just relaxed, and that surprised me. _Why would she be so free with a stranger?_ My **naive** part started kicking in. I became timid in a moment. She spoke again...

_"You are very interesting, so easy to read, yet difficult to understand. I would love you to become my partner!"_

**That got me!** _What does she mean?_ She hardly knows me, and she is talking about partnership. Now she is becoming interesting too.

I threw her a cold, dead stare... but she returned it with a smile. Thoughts and imaginations that couldn't have been mine some moments ago bustled within. My world was spinning thoughtlessly. My immunity to confusion and surprise was broken, destroyed...

_"Please, you are killing me... I apologize that I called you—or seemed to call you..."_, I finally found my voice. I sounded stupid, awkward, not real...

_"Now you don't sound like it, man!"_, she exclaimed.

I turned around, the voice in me crying for isolation, at least from her. I went off from her and started advancing towards the Igloo. She is just kinda omnipresent, and I hated that. I felt happy that my strength did not fail me in escaping her grip.

I stole a look at her again, after increasing the space between us, at the gate of the Igloo. She was sitting in my vehicle, **Jar**! I stopped in my tracks, my temper rising now. _Calm down! She is but a female..._ I noticed a bustle of rage in me, and it wasn't good. _I must breast this!_

I started back to her, _partly in fear_, _partly in shame_, and _partly in anger_. I tried to meet her gaze, but it was piercing... I couldn't maintain it. My pace reduced drastically; I was becoming timid again. _What is wrong with me?_, I asked myself. This is not the first time I met a female, or related with one. I have conversed with many of them on **Earth**.

Please don't ask me if I had been to Earth, **_I am a secret keeper!_**

_"I understood, from past records,

 that you are a secret keeper... Am I right? **yes or yes!**"_, she cut through my thoughts with these shocking words. I became very tensed now; I was perspiring, because I wasn't balanced psychologically now... maybe... even... emotionally also.

I was just a few feet away from her, but her voice was booming like she was speaking into my head. _What about the man sunbathing?_ The man was still sunbathing, without noticing the activity going on. _What is going on here?_, I couldn't help but ask myself.

_"Well, he can't see us! He is not blind though..."_, she responded.

_What is happening here?_, I was becoming more confused than ever.

_"Only accept to become my partner, and the whole picture will become clear, man!"_, she responded.

_Why is she so keen on my becoming her partner? What business is she into? What makes me the right person for the job?_ These thoughts flooded my mind. I just couldn't keep from thinking. _I needed a job, but am I going to be comfortable with what goes with this job she is offering? Why was she sitting here? Had she been waiting for my arrival?_

_"You don't need to trigger your fears and anxiety with those thoughts... I am not dangerous. I have gone through your records, and I have found that you are the best at the moment to function in this... Please accept this, and my heart will be merry!"_, she was pleading now, and that was the most sincere impression I have gotten from her since. Her pleading, searching, and beguiling eyes were so seducing in their rights that it would take more than a man, especially a job-hungry man, to reject this offer.

_What offer would be proposed to you without you knowing what the package entails beforehand?_, that, certainly, was a rhetorical question. Now I had taken my eyes off her face and was gazing at the vast field some meters behind her. A flock of sheep was grazing on the grass, though I could see no shepherd close by. The flock was having a good time, I guess... unlike I—I am in a dilemma, and a big one!

She grabbed me by my right wrist, which obviously shocked me, and led me towards **Jar**. I couldn't find the courage to argue. Around her, I feel weak. Whoever sent her is a master of his game. This woman was damn good at her job, skillful in making one gasp for breath. She is also a secret concealer, and good at it! I have just met a breed, and an interesting one.

_"Can I ask you a question?..."_, I asked her, less tensed though.

_"You wanted to ask this: 'What is your name?'"_, she replied, with a devious smile on her face.

I wondered how she read my thoughts; she is just so accurate with it. I wanted to prove her wrong, so I responded...

_"For the first time, I regret to say that you failed! I wanted to ask how you got to know me..."_

_"Don't try to term me a liar that I am not... I can see your thoughts as clearly as I see you. I don't forgive anyone that accuses me of being a liar"_, she interrupted me with a grave look. She seemed so stern and hurt now, maybe even angry. I was surprised at how such words hurt her. From the look on her face, I couldn't stand hurting her further, because I may end up at the tail of the coin.

_"I am sorry..."_, I said with deep sincerity and remorse.

_"I know you are,"_ she interrupted again. _"I know it is also painful to find out that your thoughts are clear as crystals. I just can't help letting you know. I know you have accepted the offer; you did that now."_

_"I don't know what to say, I am very dumbfounded, the worst I have experienced in months, even years,"_ I said in a low tone.

We were in the vehicle, **Jar**, and we were sitting adjacent to each other... but she was on the driver's side now. _Why?_ She started the vehicle and zoomed off.

I was surprised that she understood **Jar's** mechanism of operation—most people don't. There is a lot I am yet to know about her; this is going to be my personal mission. I am a coder now, though I have not written a single line of code (A man must certainly have a mission to become a coder). I have found a mission: To learn about the bug that just crossed my path and still gives me goosebumps. I know one thing about her though—_She is a female_. **Maybe this will be more interesting than I thought!**
