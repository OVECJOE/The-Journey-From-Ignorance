# Every Journey has a Beginning

**I woke up with a start…**

The expression written on my face, if anyone saw me, was that of excitement, maybe it isn’t excitement…or I am just confused. It would have been, say embarrassing if I was in the public. Maybe I would be considered a fanatic, or a lunatic. Forget that for now… _What caused this inexplicable expression?_

I have been thinking since a fortnight ago; I ran out of cash and was thinking of what I could do to make money…you should understand, humans do!

That night, while I was rolling over the bed, my mind in the midst of the ocean of my past mistakes, preparing scenes that never existed just to console my already caricatured mind, I caught a revelation of something that could generate the beauty in the form of money. What do you think? Do I love money? **Don’t conclude**, _this is more me than money!_

This revelation hit me so hard and so real that I felt stupid for not concocting such scheme a week or two prior. Whew! Maybe my story is becoming boring… Then the fun part!…

**I am not a human!** I wonder if you understand what this means. Here in my world, everything is a living thing, _no pun intended_. My world is an electronic world called **“Megagem”**. I never intended to reveal myself here, just know that I am the one speaking.

**I wanted to be a coder!**

**Daylight was here again, I hate to admit that I hated it…**

I rose out of bed, staggered into the bathroom, my mind preoccupied with the strategy from last night. I tried to stabilize my movement for awhile and then I took my toothbrush from a bowl where it resides. I spent about 2 minutes brushing.

Once done with that, I strode into the living room, sat on the cushion for a few seconds-or minutes, trying to organize my thoughts and prepare a schedule. When I had a set plan on what I wanted to do today and how I would go about it, I stood up and headed to the bathroom again. I had a shower, but I didn’t felt like I had one. My mind was preoccupied with thoughts of the future. I am not so sure I had a good bath, but I had one anyhow.

I selected a pant and a shirt, I wore it on and strapped my wristwatch to my wrist, and jumped into my pair of shoes. I don’t have a car - don’t think of a bike also! We don’t use one here. I have a “**mobile carpet”**, the most common means of transportation. It is a flat, carpet-like machine that is immune to air resistance. Its maximum speed is about **500km/h**. The richer ones among us use a “**breeze jet”**, which generates a powerful gust of wind and then blows the wind in a set direction… of course the user has complete control over the direction.

My **mobile carpet** is 10 years old… quite an age for such machine, I must say, especially compared to vehicles used by humans. It is really old. I should have replaced it at the age of 5, as required. According to **Bugleon city **(that’s the name of my city in case you didn’t notice) law: “_Every vehicle is identified by a mega id which expires every 5 years, and must be renewed once expired. If not obeyed, a fine of \*\*\* would be paid, and the vehicle will be confiscated.”_

I forgot. I have given out too much information -&nbsp;**damn my ill-tamed lips! **I flickered into my pal, the machine. I called her **Jar**. I zoomed off with an excited mind full of ideas - sorry, idea, not even sure.

***

**Jar came to a stop in front of an Igloo…**

Alighting from her, I stole a quick glance around the vicinity. I noticed a woman that was staring at **Jar**. She seems to be attracted by some features that I couldn’t depict. I also noticed a man sitting in the sun, having a sunbath. He didn't even looked up, let alone acknowledge my presence. I looked at the woman one more time, and nodded at her. That was all she needed, she started, strutting, her hands on her hips, and with such elegance that I couldn't help but admire her gaiety. She was radiating, now I noticed it. She stopped few feets away from me.

*"You called for me?"*, she said, her voice sounded distant, like it wasn't me the question was directed to.

I was confused, my mind bewildered. I looked into her eyes, trying to find a sentence, phrase, or word to reply her with. I haven't had any human interaction in two months, and it just dawn on me. She noticed my confusion, and she said same...

*"You are confused, I can read that in your eyes, and I like that!"*, she said, a smile smirked her face, her eyes lit up. I noticed she was just relaxed, and that surprised me. <u>*Why would be she so free with a stranger?*</u> My **naive** part started kicking in. I became timid in a moment. She spoke again...

*"You are very interesting, so easy to read, yet difficult to understand. I will love you become my partner!"*

**That got me!** <u>*What does she mean?*</u> She hardly knows me and she is talking about partnership. Now she is becoming interesting too.

I threw her a cold, dead stare...but she returned it with a smile. Thoughts and imaginations, that couldn't have been mine some moments ago, bustled within. My world was spinning thoughtlessly. My immunity to confusion and surprise was broken, destroyed...

*"Please you are killing me... I apologized that I called you -&nbsp;or seemed to call you..."*, I finally found my voice. I sounded stupid, awkward, not real...

*"Now you don't sound like it man!"*, she exclaimed.

I turned around, the voice in me crying for isolation, at least from her. I went off from her, and started advancing towards the Igloo. She is just kinda omnipresent, and I hated that. I felt happy that my strength did not fail me from escaping her grip.

I stole a look at her again, after increasing the space between us, at the gate of the Igloo. She was sitting in my vehicle, **Jar**! I stopped in my tracks, my temper rising now. <u>*Calm down! She is but a female...*</u> I noticed a bustle of rage in me, and it wasn't good. <u>*I must breast this!*</u>

I started back to her, *partly in fear*, *partly in shame*, and *partly in anger*. I tried to meet her gaze, but it was piercing... I couldn't maintain it. My pace reduced drastically, I was becoming timid again. <u>*What is wrong with me?*</u>, I asked myself. This is not the first time I met a female, or related with one. I have conversed with many of them on **Earth**.

Please don't ask me if I had been to Earth, ***I am a secret keeper!***

*"I understood, from past records, that you are a secret keeper... Am I right? **yes or yes!**"*, she cut through my thoughts with this shocking words. I became very tensed now, I was perspiring, because I wasn't balanced psychologically now...maybe...even...emotionally also.

I was just a few feet away from her, but her voice was booming like she was speaking into my head. <u>*What about the man sunbathing?*</u> The man was still sunbathing, without noticing the activity going on. <u>*What is going on here?*</u>, I couldn't help but ask myself.

*"Well, he can't see us! He is not blind though..."*, she responded.

<u>*What is happening here?*</u>, I was becoming confused more than ever.

*"Only accept to become my partner, and the whole picture will become clear man!"*, she responded.

<u>*Why is she so keen with my becoming her partner? What business is she into? What makes me the right person for the job?*</u> These thoughts flooded my mind. I just couldn't keep from thinking. <u>*I needed a job, but am I going to be comfortable with what goes with this job she is offering? Why was she sitting here? Had she been waiting for my arrival?*</u>

*"You don't need to trigger your fears and anxiety with those thoughts...I am not dangerous, I have gone through your records, and I have found that you are the best at the moment to function in this... Please accept this, and my heart will be merry!"*, she was pleading now and that was the most sincere impression I have gotten from her since. Her pleading, searching, and beguiling eyes were so seducing in their rights that it would take more than a man, especially a job-hungry man, to reject this offer.

<u>*What offer would be proposed to you without you knowing what the package entails beforehand?*</u>, that, certainly, was a rhetorical question. Now I had taken my eyes off her face and was gazing at the vast field some meters behind her. A flock of sheep were grazing on the grass, though I could see no shepherd close by. The flock was having a good time, I guess...unlike I &mdash;I am in a dilemma, and a big one!

She grabbed me by my right wrist, which obviously shocked me, and led me towards **Jar**. I couldn't find the courage to argue. Around her, I feel weak. Whoever sent her is a master of his game. This woman was damn good at her job, skillful in making one gasp for breath. She is also a secret concealer, and good at it! I have just met a breed, and an interesting one.

*"Can I ask you a question?..."*, I asked her, less tensed though.

*"You wanted to ask this: 'What is your name?'"*, she replied, with a devious smile on her face.

I wondered how she read my thoughts, she is just so accurate with it. I wanted to prove her wrong, so I responded...

*"For the first time, I regret to say that you failed! I wanted to ask how you got to know me..."*

*"Don't try to term me a liar that I am not... I can see your thoughts as clearly as I see you. I don't forgive anyone that accuses me of being a liar"*, she interrupted me with a grave look. She seemed so stern and hurt now, maybe even angry. I was surprised at how such words hurt her. From the look on her face, I couldn't stand hurting her further, because I may end up at the tail of the coin.

*"I am sorry..."*, I said with deep sincerity and remorse.

*"I know you are."*, she interrupted again. *"I know it is also painful to find out that your thoughts are clear as crystals. I just can't help letting you know. I know you have accepted the offer, you did that now."*

*"I don't know what to say, I am very dumbfounded, the worst I have experienced in months, even years."*, I said in a low tone.

We were in the vehicle, **Jar**, and we were sitting adjacent to each other...but she was on the driver's side now. <u>*Why?*</u> She started the vehicle, and zoomed off.

I was surprised that she understood **Jar's** mechanism of operation &mdash;most people don't. There are a lot I am yet to know about her, this is going to be my personal mission. I am a coder now, though I have not written a single line of code (A man must certainly have a mission to become a coder). I have to mission: To learn about the bug that just crossed my path and gives me goosebumps. I know one thing about her though &mdash;_She is a female_. **Maybe this will be more interesting than I thought!**
